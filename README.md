# 🧩 Modern Arch Linux Workflows

Using technologies that Arch supports natively today, **not workflows from 2016**.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **systemd-boot** (optional; direct UKI boot used ideally)
- **UKI (Unified Kernel Images)**
- **sbctl Secure Boot key management**
- **TPM2 & systemd-cryptenroll**
- **Btrfs with subvolumes**
- **mkinitcpio with UKI presets**
- **AppArmor + LSM stacking**
- **Kernel hardening flags**
- **Flatpak sandboxing**

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a Linux user and security enthusiast who enjoys:

- Understanding things deeply rather than using them blindly
- Building strong, modern systems from scratch
- Learning how the boot chain and OS internals truly work
- Exploring security, cryptography, and system design
- Writing clean, minimal documentation so others can follow along

This project started as my personal installation notes.
Now, it has evolved into a public guide for anyone who wants to build a **hardened Arch Linux system from the ground up**.
